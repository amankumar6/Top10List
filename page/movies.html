                    The Godfather Part II is a 1974 American epic crime film produced and directed by Francis Ford
                    Coppola from the screenplay co-written with Mario Puzo, starring Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane

                    picks up the 1958 story of Michael Corleone (Pacino), the new Don of the Corleone family, protecting
                    the family business in the aftermath of an attempt on his life; the prequel covers the journey of
                    his father, Vito Corleone (De Niro), from his Sicilian childhood to the founding of his family
                    enterprise in New York City.
