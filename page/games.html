                    Grand Theft Auto V is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and published by
                    Rockstar Games. It is the first main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series since 2008's Grand Theft
                    Auto IV. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas, based on Southern California, the
                    single-player story follows three protagonists—retired bank robber Michael De Santa, street gangster
                    Franklin Clinton, and drug dealer and arms smuggler Trevor Philips—and their efforts to commit
                    heists while under pressure from a corrupt government agency and powerful crime figures. The open
                    world design lets players freely roam San Andreas' open countryside and the fictional city of Los
                    Santos, based on Los Angeles.

                    The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an action role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios
                    and published by Bethesda Softworks. It is the fifth main installment in The Elder Scrolls series,
                    following The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows,
                    PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 on November 11, 2011. The game's main story revolves around the player's
                    character, the Dragonborn, on their quest to defeat Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon who is
                    prophesied to destroy the world. The game is set 200 years after the events of Oblivion and takes
                    place in Skyrim, the northernmost province of Tamriel. Over the course of the game, the player
                    completes quests and develops the character by improving skills. The game continues the open-world
                    tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any
                    time, and to ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely.

                    Fortnite is an online video game developed by Epic Games and released in 2017. It is available in
                    three distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine:
                    Fortnite: Save the World, a cooperative shooter-survival game for up to four players to fight off
                    zombie-like creatures and defend objects with fortifications they can build; Fortnite Battle Royale,
                    a free-to-play battle royale game where up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; and
                    Fortnite Creative, where players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas. Save
                    the World and Battle Royale were released in 2017 as early access titles, while Creative was
                    released on December 6, 2018. Save the World is available only for Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4,
                    and Xbox One, while Battle Royale and Creative released for all those platforms, and also for
                    Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android devices. The game is expected to also launch with the release of
                    the next-generation PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles.

                    Half-Life, it combines shooting, puzzles, and storytelling, and adds features such as vehicles and
                    physics-based gameplay. Players control Gordon Freeman, who fights the alien Combine with allies
                    including resistance fighter Alyx Vance, using weapons such as the object-manipulating gravity gun.

                    Portal 2 is a puzzle-platform game developed by Valve. It was released in April 2011 for Windows,
                    Mac OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. The digital PC version is distributed online by
                    Valve's Steam service, while all retail editions were distributed by Electronic Arts. Like the
                    original Portal (2007), players solve puzzles by placing portals and teleporting between them.
                    Portal 2 adds features including tractor beams, lasers, light bridges, and paint-like gels that
                    alter player movement or allow portals to be placed on any surface. In the single-player campaign,
                    players control Chell, who navigates the dilapidated Aperture Science Enrichment Center during its
                    reconstruction by the supercomputer GLaDOS (Ellen McLain); new characters include robot Wheatley
                    (Stephen Merchant) and Aperture founder Cave Johnson (J. K. Simmons). In the new cooperative mode,
                    players solve puzzles together as robots Atlas and P-Body (both voiced by Dee Bradley Baker).
                    Jonathan Coulton and The National produced songs for the game.

                    Overwatch is a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter developed and published by Blizzard
                    Entertainment. Described as a "hero shooter", Overwatch assigns players into two teams of six, with
                    each player selecting from a roster of over 30 characters, known as "heroes", each with a unique
                    style of play that is divided into three general roles that fit their purpose. Players on a team
                    work together to secure and defend control points on a map or escort a payload across the map in a
                    limited amount of time. Players gain cosmetic rewards that do not affect gameplay, such as character
                    skins and victory poses, as they play the game. The game was initially launched with only casual
                    play, but a competitive ranked mode, various 'arcade' game modes, and a player-customizable server
                    browser were added after release. Additionally, Blizzard has added new characters, maps, and game
                    modes post-release, all free of charge, with the only additional cost to players being optional loot
                    boxes to earn cosmetic items. It was released for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows in May 2016,
                    and Nintendo Switch in October 2019.

                    Red Dead Redemption 2 is a 2018 action-adventure game developed and published by Rockstar Games. The

                    Redemption. The story is set in 1899 in a fictionalized representation of the Western, Midwestern,
                    and Southern United States and follows outlaw Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van der Linde gang.
                    Arthur must deal with the decline of the Wild West whilst attempting to survive against government
                    forces, rival gangs, and other adversaries. The story also follows fellow gang member John Marston,
                    the protagonist of Red Dead Redemption.

                    PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is an online multiplayer battle royale game developed and
                    published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of South Korean video game company Bluehole. The game is
                    based on previous mods that were created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, inspired
                    by the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative
                    direction. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons
                    and equipment to kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of
                    the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into tighter areas to force
                    encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round.

                    Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve. The
                    game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), which was a community-created mod for Blizzard
                    Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion pack, The Frozen Throne. Dota 2 is
                    played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their
                    own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character,
                    known as a "hero", who all have unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match,
                    players collect experience points and items for their heroes to successfully defeat the opposing
                    team's heroes in player versus player combat. A team wins by being the first to destroy the other
                    team's "Ancient", a large structure located within their base.
