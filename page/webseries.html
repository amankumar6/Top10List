                    Breaking Bad is an American neo-Western crime drama television series created and produced by Vince
                    Gilligan. The show aired on AMC from January 20, 2008, to September 29, 2013, consisting of five
                    seasons for a total of 62 episodes. It was set and filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and tells the
                    story of Walter White (Bryan Cranston), an underemployed and depressed high school chemistry teacher
                    who is struggling with a recent diagnosis of stage-three lung cancer. White turns to a life of
                    crime, partnering with his former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), by producing and distributing
                    crystallized methamphetamine to secure his family's financial future before he dies, while
                    navigating the dangers of the criminal underworld. The title is a Southern colloquialism meaning to
                    turn to a life of crime. Gilligan characterized the series as showing Walter's transformation from a
                    soft-spoken Mr. Chips into Scarface.

                    Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey is a 2014 American science documentary television series. The show is a
                    follow-up to the 1980 television series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, which was presented by Carl Sagan
                    on the Public Broadcasting Service and is considered a milestone for scientific documentaries. This
                    series was developed to bring back the foundation of science to network television at the height of
                    other scientific-based television series and films. The show is presented by astrophysicist Neil
                    deGrasse Tyson, who, as a young high school student, was inspired by Sagan. Among the executive
                    producers are Seth MacFarlane, whose financial investment was instrumental in bringing the show to
                    broadcast television, and Ann Druyan, a co-author and co-creator of the original television series
                    and Sagan's wife. The show is produced by Brannon Braga, and Alan Silvestri composed the backing
                    score.

                    Avatar: The Last Airbender (Avatar: The Legend of Aang in some regions) is an American animated
                    television series created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, with Aaron Ehasz as head
                    writer. The show is sometimes called Avatar or ATLA by fans. It aired on Nickelodeon for three
                    seasons, from February 2005 to July 2008. Avatar is set in an Asiatic-like world in which some
                    people can manipulate the classical elements with psychokinetic variants of the Chinese martial arts
                    known as "bending". One individual, the Avatar, is capable of bending all four elements and is
                    responsible for maintaining harmony between the world's four nations. It is presented in a style
                    that combines anime with American cartoons, and relies on the imagery of East Asian, South Asian,
                    Inuit, and New World societies.
