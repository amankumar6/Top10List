                    If you take a look at Billboard’s Hot 100 Songs of 2017, you’ll find Despacito in the number two
                    spot. It’s pretty clear that popular songs can also become highly watched YouTube videos. And with
                    over 6.15 billion video views, it’s pretty clear why this is the most watched YouTube video. You
                    have the music repeat factor where you watch it over again just to hear the song. And back in 2017
                    Spotify was popular, but not as popular as it is today. Despacito’s video has all the trademarks of
                    a popular music video: dance sequences, good-looking people, palm trees, naturescapes, club scene,
                    and of course the catchiest song to sing along to. The song is entirely in Spanish, making it one of
                    the three on this top ten most viewed YouTube videos list that aren’t in English.

                    <br><br>
                    The second most viewed YouTube video is the Shape of You music video with over 4.17 billion video
                    views. Another interesting tidbit is that it was actually the number one on Billboard’s Hot 100
                    Songs of 2017, beating out Despacito. Unlike most videos, where the singer sings in front of the
                    camera, Shape of You is like a 4-minute movie telling the story of an athletic couple, and the song
                    is just background music. The movie style music video isn’t too common, which makes it a compelling
                    love story to watch. There are also some funny moments where Ed Sheeran and a sumo wrestler fight in
                    the ultimate match. It also has a profound female empowerment message in it: Sheeran is a weakling
                    compared to his love interest.

                    See You Again is the main song for the Fast and Furious 7 movie. One of the stars, Paul Walker, died
                    in an infamous car crash shortly before its release. The song and music video are a tribute to Paul
                    Walker and his journey in the Fast and Furious series. If you take a look at the video’s comments,
                    you’ll see several notes about Paul Walker, suggesting that the video went viral because of his
                    sudden death. The song in the video was also popular enough to earn a number three spot in the
                    Billboard Hot 100 for 2015. The sad tone of the song and video make it worth watching over and over
                    again. Emotions can play a big role in helping make a video go viral. Everyone can relate to the
                    pain you feel from losing a loved one, which helps make this one of the most viewed YouTube videos
                    of all time.

                    <br><br>
                    Uptown Funk was the number one song of 2015 on the Billboard Hot 100. According to Joe Bennett, a
                    music professor at Bath Spa University, the song’s popularity is due to two key elements: a lack of
                    a chorus and a slower tempo. These two elements make the song stand out. And as we’ve seen with
                    other songs on this list, a number one hit makes it easier to score one of the most viewed YouTube
                    videos. Another interesting tidbit is that Bruno Mars performed at the 2014 Super Bowl halftime
                    show, which helped elevate his popularity and make his video more viral. The video itself has an
                    old-school feel to it which makes it a unique watch that you don’t really see in music videos
                    anymore.

                    <br><br>
                    Gangnam Style was once the most viewed YouTube video of all time, as it was the first YouTube video
                    to reach one billion views. The song is undeniably catchy, but the video shines with a level of
                    quirkiness mainstream American media hadn’t seen before. The silly dance moves in unexpected places
                    just makes this an all around fun video to watch. And let’s be honest, you’ve probably tried Psy’s
                    dance moves yourself. The YouTube video has a carefree element which makes it easy to just allow
                    yourself to be entertained while watching. With over 3.7 billion YouTube video views since it was
                    published in July 2012, it’s pretty clear that Psy’s colorful personality is what helped make this
                    video a raving success.

                    Sorry, the sixth most watched Music video on YouTube, is quite a unique music video. Throughout the
                    entire three minutes and 25 seconds, I waited… and waited… for Justin Bieber. It’s basically a
                    Waiting for Godot music video because *spoiler alert* the Biebs just never shows up. Instead, the
                    entire music video features an all-female dance crew in neon outfits and expressive faces. One of
                    the non-song related reasons why this video might’ve been popular is because you can literally dance
                    along with the simple moves. Some might’ve chosen to add this to a workout playlist on YouTube which
                    can help elevate the number of views it gets. But aside from that, Justin Bieber currently has four
                    music videos with over one billion YouTube views, so it’s likely that his 44.45 million YouTube
                    subscribers help boost his videos’ viral success.

                    "Sugar" is a song which is recorded by American band Maroon 5 for their fifth studio album V (2014).
                    It was written by Mike Posner, Adam Levine, Dr. Luke, and Jacob Kasher Hindlin together with its
                    producers Ammo and Cirkut. It was sent to contemporary hit radio in the United States, as the third
                    single from the album on January 13, 2015. "Sugar" is a disco, funk-pop, and soul song that features
                    a wide range of instruments including percussion, keyboards and guitars. Commercially, the song
                    peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 and became the band's third top 10 single from V,
                    and eighth consecutive top 10 entry. "Sugar" is the 68th song in history to score at least 20 weeks
                    in the top 10 of the Hot 100.

                    Katy Perry is the first female on this list so far with her ever-catchy song and video for Roar. In
                    the video, Perry is stranded in a jungle after a plane crash and is forced to survive on her own
                    after her partner is eaten by a tiger. The comical video shows Perry constantly facing her fears,
                    striving to survive, and taming animals while wearing scantily clad outfits. While Katy’s song was
                    popular, landing at number 10 on the top 100 songs in 2013, her sizable fanbase of 33 million
                    subscribers helped launch her view to a 2.8 billion view count. Plus, as with any lead single, it
                    usually gets the biggest budget and most hype, which helps her land the most viewed YouTube video
                    for a female artist.

                    "Thinking Out Loud" is a song by English singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran, recorded for his second
                    studio album, × (2014). It was written by Sheeran and Amy Wadge, and produced by frequent
                    collaborator Jake Gosling. It was released in the US on 24 September 2014 as the album's third
                    single. In the UK, the song spent 19 weeks within the top 40 before peaking at number one in early
                    November 2014; it became Sheeran's second number one single there. The single has also reached the
                    top spot in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Denmark, the Netherlands, Slovakia and South Africa,
                    and peaked at number two on both the US Billboard Hot 100 and the Canadian Hot 100. It was Sheeran's
                    highest-charting single in North America until "Shape of You" topped the charts in both countries in
                    2017.
