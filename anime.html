                        This anime blew my mind each episode resides something new and interesting. I was restless to watch the next episode. Even, wasn’t able to wait for the season 3 and read the manga completely to 101 chapters the next day. People thinking season 2 is best, wait for the book in basement. It will totally blow your Mind.
